utils
=====

This is largely me testing github.

The repo contains various utils for my personal use.

gather.py
=====

A script which moves some system files into a diskless client's root filesystem.

    Usage:  gather.py -h -t <title>

        -h  Shows the help message
        -t <title>  Where title is that of the destination directory.
